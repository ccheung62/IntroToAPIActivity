## Activity 4
 - Create a console app with a class that has an interface and push it to a git repo! 
 - Your class should have at least one interface and three different types of properties.
 - The interface (and therefore, your class) should have at least three out of these four things:
    - instance methods
    - properties
    - events
    - indexers.

Make sure you have an instance of this class in main!

* You have until the 20th at 11:45pm to complete this assignment. Good luck!!!
